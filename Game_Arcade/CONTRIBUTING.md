- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Code Structure
```python
class NewGame:
    """
    Brief description of the game.
    Explain the rules and objectives.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, game_suite):
        """Initialize with game suite reference."""
        self.game_suite = game_suite
        # Initialize game state
    
    def play_game(self):
        """Main game loop with error handling."""
        try:
            # Game implementation
            pass
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\\n❌ Game cancelled.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\\n❌ Error: {e}")
```

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise comments
- Explain complex algorithms
- Document all public methods
- Include usage examples

## 🎮 Adding New Games

### Game Integration Template
```python
# your_game.py
class YourGame:
    def __init__(self, game_suite):
        self.game_suite = game_suite
    
    def play_game(self):
        """Main game implementation"""
        # Game logic here
        pass
    
    def calculate_score(self, performance_metrics):
        """Calculate and return game score"""
        pass

# Integration function
def integrate_your_game(game_suite):
    def run_your_game():
        if not game_suite.current_player:
            print("❌ Please login first")
            return
        game = YourGame(game_suite)
        game.play_game()
    
    # Add to games dictionary
    game_suite.games['5'] = {
        'name': 'Your Game Name',
        'class': run_your_game
    }
```
